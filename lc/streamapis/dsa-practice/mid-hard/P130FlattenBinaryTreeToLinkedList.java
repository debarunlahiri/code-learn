/**
 * P130. Flatten Binary Tree To Linked List. This is a mid-to-hard Java DSA
 * coding problem commonly
 * seen in service based company technical rounds. Implement the required method
 * using an efficient
 * algorithm, not brute force where a better standard approach exists. The
 * solution should handle
 * boundary cases, duplicate values, disconnected states, and large inputs
 * according to the method
 * signature. Return the final computed value or data structure exactly as the
 * platform-style method
 * expects.
