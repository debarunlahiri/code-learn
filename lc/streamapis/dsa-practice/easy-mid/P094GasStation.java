 * P094. Gas Station. This is a easy-to-mid Java DSA coding problem commonly

 * required operation efficiently and return the expected result. Handle normal
 * edge cases such as
 * empty collections, duplicate values, boundary indexes, and null child
 * pointers when the data
 * structure allows them. Prefer the standard optimal approach used in coding
 * rounds, and keep the
 * implementation readable for revision.
